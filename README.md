# Credit Card Validator System

## Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Validator System with a frontend interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend server written in Go. The system validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm and provides immediate feedback on the card's validity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Go
- **Validation Algorithm**: Luhn Algorithm
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **HTTP Server**: Go’s `net/http` package

## Features

- **Credit Card Validation**: Uses the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly interface with a warm gradient background and smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Validation**: Provides real-time feedback on card validity.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Luhn Algorithm

Validates credit card numbers to ensure they meet the Luhn checksum requirement.

### 2. HTTP Server

Created using Go’s `net/http` package.

### 3. Request Handling

Configured to handle GET requests with JSON payloads.

### 4. JSON Payload Handling

- **Validation**: Accepts valid JSON requests; rejects invalid ones with an HTTP 400 status code.
- **Extraction**: Extracts the credit card number from the JSON payload.

### 5. Validation and Response

- **Processing**: Runs the Luhn algorithm on the extracted credit card number.
- **Response**: Wraps the result in a JSON response payload and returns it to the user.
